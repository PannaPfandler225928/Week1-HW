## Milestone in AI
Chess victories â€“ defeating the world champion
In 1996, IBMs Deep Blue achieved the first single-game victory against reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. (Though it lost the match.)

In the following year, an updated version of Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in a 6-game match, winning two, losing one, and drawing three. This victory over humans is one of the most prominent milestones in artificial intelligence.
